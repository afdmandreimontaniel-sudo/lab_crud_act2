Conclusion:

In working on this project, most of the errors I encountered were due to small details such as typing mistakes and missed configurations. 
These issues became more noticeable during the setup and testing phase in Postman, especially when inserting data. Although they were minor, 
they taught me the importance of paying attention to detail and carefully checking both code and request inputs. Overall, these challenges 
helped me improve my troubleshooting skills and better understand how the API works in practice.
